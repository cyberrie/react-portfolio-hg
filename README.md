## Overview

I've built React portfolio site to solidify my React skills and showcase my current project to my potential employer.

## Required Components

This portfolio was built whilst keeping in mind below:

- Navigation using React Router, dynamicrendering, or another third party router

- Portfolio must render at least 6 components:

  - App: as a top-level component, rendering all child components

  - Header: must render across every page and contain a Navbar

  - Home Page: landing page with name, an avatar, brand statement

  - Pojects Page: must render 6 instances of the project component dynamically

    - Project can be reusable component that ingests JSON data and renders a single instance for each project

  - Contact Page: email, GitHub, LinkedIn, CV, Contact Form
